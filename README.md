# bipolar_diary
This repository documents the evolution of a privacy-first bipolar mood journal built with Python. It serves as both a structured mood-tracking CLI project and a transparent record of my programming growth. Only source code and development logs are shared here; personal journal data remains strictly local and is never uploaded.
